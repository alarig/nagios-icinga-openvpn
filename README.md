# nagios-icinga-checks

## Background
The here listed nagios-icinga-checks were created during my work for credativ GmbH.

## How to use
The usage of the checks depends on what kind of checks they are:
* nrpe plugins must be copied to the monitoring client
* normal checks must be run on the monitoring server
